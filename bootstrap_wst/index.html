                        tour or practice your killer spike on the beach-volleyball court at Atwayan Beach. Jungle treks,
                        horseback tours and island camping will further quench your thirst for the ultimate outdoor
                        experience. It has caught the attention of many due to its World War II wreck diving spots,
                        beautiful rock formations, and unbelievably clear waters. It is also considered the more quiet
                        and laidback sibling of El Nido, another famous Palawan destination because of its gorgeous

                        it is known for its perfectly conical shape whose natural beauty has inspired a number of
                        legends and art. The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by UNESCO in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site.</p>
